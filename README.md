#### - Is this plugin lightweight?  
Yes. It loads ~40kb of code when it runs. 

#### - Does this plugin require any other plugin?

Yes. It implements the standard JWT-based SSO endpoint (`/access/jwt`).

#### - Is Composer required?  
No. The JWT library is bundled directly in the plugin for convenience.

#### - Does this plugin store any user data?  
No. It simply authenticates the current logged-in WordPress user and securely passes their name and email to Zendesk for SSO. No personal data is logged or retained by the plugin.

#### - Can I customize the login redirect page?

No, it runs independently. It only triggers when the `[tokenlink_zendesk_login]` shortcode is executed, so it won‚Äôt interfere with other authentication systems.

#### - Does this plugin work with Cloudflare or reverse proxies?  
Yes. As long as HTTPS and PHP sessions function normally, JWT SSO works over any proxy or CDN.

#### - I‚Äôm getting a 502 or redirect loop. What should I check?  
Verify your Zendesk subdomain and shared secret are correct, and that your Zendesk SSO settings point to your WordPress page URL containing `[tokenlink_zendesk_login]`.
